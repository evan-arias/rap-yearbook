                <h3>"Peppas" - Westside Gunn</h3>
                <p>In 2022, Westside Gunn dropped his album "10," which is an ongoing series of "Hitler Wears Hermes" similar to "The Devil Wears Prada". 
                "Peppas" is filled with high fashion, street narratives, and the legacy of gangsta rap. Westside Gunn's combination of street culture and luxury brands represents modern hip-hop's ongoing evolution. 
                Gunn features the old icon rap group Black Star, a duo of Yasiin Bey and Talib Kweli.</p>

                <h4>Historical Significance</h4>
                <p>"Peppas" revisits a luxury rap style, blending street struggles with high-end fashion lyrically and visually in the music video. Westside Gunn, known for his gangster rap roots, continues to reference hustling and drug culture, even now that he is financially successful. In "The Book of Rhymes: The Poetics of Hip-Hop," Adam Bradley states, "Rap lyrics are so closely bound to the image and identity of the performer that the very idea of a distinction seems counterintuitive" (Bradley 154). Gunn draws inspiration from his "Hitler Wears Hermes" album series, where he fuses personal success with street credibility, highlighting luxury brands like Hermes. Despite this, "Peppas" retains its gangster rap essence. Gunn's influences from legends like Jay-Z, Nas, and Wu-Tang Clan—who all told gritty street tales with deep, introspective lyrics—are evident. In one line, Gunn raps, "My shit feel like it is Illmatic again." In his book, Shea Serrano mentioned "Illmatic" as the second-best album of 1994, just behind "Ready to Die". Gunn's collaboration with Black Star (Yasiin Bey and Talib Kweli) injects more raw street energy into the track. The production and beat echo 90s rap, bringing back the boom-bap style while incorporating luxury elements. Peppas continues the traditional hip-hop narrative of boasting and showing off, but Gunn keeps it authentic with his street credibility intact.</p>

                
                <blockquote>“So much coke, he had to get the baking soda from Costco's”</blockquote>

                <h4>Cultural Significance</h4>
                <p>The cultural significance of "Peppas" speaks to the idea of wealth and status in American culture. "Peppas" shows that society values material success and that fashion and wealth show that achievement. Gunn connects the song with the American Dream of making it big, having luxury brands, and driving exotic cars. The song is about self-made success followed by the American Dream. In America, wealth and luxury are seen as having power and influence. Westside Gunn uses his lyrics to reflect that fashion and money are the key to achieving respect and recognition. "Peppas" represents gender and race through masculinity in hip-hop, with strength, wealth, and power. The usage of high-end brands and the luxurious lifestyle touches the class element. Tricia Rose, author of "The Hip Hop Wars," states, "The most commercially promoted and financially successful hip hop has increasingly become a playground for caricatures of black gangstas, pimps, and hoes.". The song does not touch on the family side of things but discusses the importance of respect and legacy in the hip-hop community. Artists form family-like bonds with one another.</p>
                
                <blockquote>“LV snapback with the Crips that's backwards”</blockquote>

                <h4>Personal Significance</h4>
                <p>I first heard “Peppas” in November of 2022. I was at the 24 Hour Fitness gym in West Covina, CA. It was 5:30 am, and I remember listening to the whole song and repeating it a few times. It reminds me of Wu-Tang Clan and Nas, having the gangster rap with luxury fashion; their struggle was the starting point for building their empire. “Peppas” speaks to me because I am constantly grinding and pushing myself to accomplish everything in my mind. Although I was not in the struggle like Westside Gunn, being self-made is what aligned with me perfectly and working to get to that point. One theme that stuck with me is that everyone in the song addressed themselves as “FlyGods.” Gunn and everyone else in the song asserted themselves in the position that self-control and the belief in one’s self is true power. Westside Gunn never waited for success to come knocking on his door. Instead, he went out to get it himself.</p>

                <blockquote>“Bitches love the FLYGOD, all these n****s cappin'”</blockquote>

                    </a>
                </div>

                <h3>"Watch This" (ARIZONATEARS PluggNb Remix) - Lil Uzi Vert</h3>
                <p>Lil Uzi Vert has always had songs leaked, and this song was highly anticipated by fans. In 2023, Uzi finally dropped 'Watch This,' and it blew up, showcasing his ability to seamlessly blend elements of trap, emo rap, and punk into his sound. "Rap offers a variety unrivaled in contemporary literature" (Bradley), and Uzi's music is a prime example of that variety. His sound reflects a wide range of musical influences, from hard-hitting beats to emotional melodies, making his work stand out in the modern rap scene.</p>
                
                <h4>Historical Significance</h4>
                <p>For the past few years, Lil Uzi Vert has made some music that is very significant in hip-hop. Many people try to leak his unreleased music and get him to drop the music. When “Watch This” was leaked, it was back in 2022, but a year later, he dropped “Watch This (ARIZONATEARS PluggNb Remix).” The song represents the constant trend in hip-hop, where an artist flaunts his wealth, fame, and crazy lifestyle. This song is a colossal brag showing that hip-hop is a platform to showcase material success and dominance in the industry. “Watch This” highlights “money, power, and respect” all by making wealth and materialistic things the center of the song. Uzi uses a lot of catchy beats and flashy wordplay, which are the main points in trap music; however, Uzi elevates this with his confidence and vulnerability. Lil Uzi Vert continues pushing the traditional bold confidence of being flashy like some legends such as Jay-Z and Kanye West. Shea Serrano wrote “The connection is a feat only an ego as massive as Kanye’s could orchestrate”. Sonically, the song evokes trap music with heavy bass, fast-paced beats, and catchy hooks.</p>
                
                <blockquote>“Benjamins sittin' in my left, right pocket, watch this”</blockquote>

                <h4>Cultural Significance</h4>
                <p>On the cultural side, "Watch This" was more significant than most people had anticipated. According to Billboard Pro, "The new edit, which has been out since late last year, has (according to Arizonatears on the song's YouTube) now been officially sanctioned by Uzi's Atlantic Records label, and is taking off on streaming – with nearly 4.4 million official on-demand U.S. streams for the week ending Feb. 16, up 265.1% from the week before, according to Luminate." This is huge since the song was leaked, and now that it officially came out, it has been constantly played over and over. Even though this song is a remix, it still helped Uzi in the long run. Another Billboard Pro post stated, "Bootleg remixes that earn an artist's blessing can also help push the original further up the Hot 100." The song speaks about the obsession with materialism and fame, which are big things in our society now. Tricia Rose argues, "Many who claim that hip hop hurts black people conveniently leave out (or at least remain silent about) the extensive role of corporate power and white desire as key ingredients in creating the centrality of self-destructive ideas and images in commercial hip hop." This idea resonates with Uzi's portrayal of the material success that drives his music. External displays such as flashy cars, high-end brands, and wealth determine American society's status. "Watch This" touches on a few elements of gender, not so much race or family. Again, being a male shows masculinity, wealth, and confidence, whereas in hip-hop, it is an essential key. Family is only touched upon with the reflection of "brotherhood," but race is only brought up to say it does not matter what race you are; you can rise above it all.</p>                
                
                
                <blockquote>“No matter in the world where I'm gon' go, I never tuck in my jewels”</blockquote>

                <h4>Personal Significance</h4>
                <p>The first time I heard “Watch This” was in 2022 at Alhambra Golf Course; my cousin had played it for me while we waited to tee off. The first time I heard the remix was when it was released, and I remember how good I felt while listening to it. The song was my celebration when I would pass my Calculus 2 exams; it helped ease the pressure on my mind and the high I got from doing well. The song reached me on the level that while I am pushing for success, there will always be problems or challenges that stand in the way. In those moments, I need to live in the moment and accept the fact that I will overcome these problems and be more assertive. One line that stuck with me is, “I cannot get tired of money, but this money will turn people right into greed.” Uzi touches on the fact that people ultimately change when money is involved, and it sometimes shows their true colors. The repetition of “Watch This” constantly presents confidence and pride in achievements.</p>

                <h3>"Not Like Us" - Kendrick Lamar</h3>
                <p>In 2024, The Beef between Kendrick Lamar and Drake hit an all-time high, especially leading into the summer. 
                    Kendrick Lamar would drop "Not Like Us," which explores Kendrick's critique of the commercialization of hip-hop and the authenticity of artists in the industry, positioning him as the critic of mainstream success. 
                    He would rip apart the OVO crew and ultimately leave this song as a brand of 2024.</p>

                <h4>Historical Significance</h4>
                <p>Kendrick Lamar released “Not Like Us” in May 2024, which gathered many people to come back and revisit hip-hop; it has been achieving widespread acclaim. “Not Like Us” revisits the traditional rap battle, something embedded in the hip-hop culture. Kendrick Lamar’s lyrical powers and confrontation with Drake echo throughout the song, and it is the competitive spirit where artists need to stay engaged and locked in during these lyrical battles to assert dominance over the other. “Not Like Us” underscores the legacy of storytelling and even the social commentary in hip-hop. Aside from the personal attacks on Drake, Lamar dives into themes of authenticity, industry politics, and even cultural appropriation. This is major because he uses hip-hop’s role as his standing platform to address these problems. On a sonic level, the song uses trap beats with some hip-hop rhythms. The producer, Mustard, has the beat to enhance Lamar’s complex lyrics, which makes the song more powerful and impactful.</p>

                <blockquote>“Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles”</blockquote>

                <h4>Cultural Significance</h4>
                <p>Culturally, "Not Like Us" speaks to the audience about authenticity and the exploitation of Black artistry within the music industry. Kendrick Lamar critiques the appropriation of Black culture, highlighting systemic problems beyond hip-hop. Zen Howard, writing for Elev8, argues that "Not Like Us" opens a broader conversation in hip-hop about artists speaking to Black culture for personal gain, often without a genuine connection to its struggles, experiences, and triumphs. The song also critiques American society's obsession with celebrity feuds and its hunger for drama. Lamar uses his lyrics to reveal the disconnect that exists behind the scenes. Tricia Rose contends that "many who claim that hip hop hurts black people conveniently leave out (or at least remain silent about) the extensive role of corporate power and white desire as key ingredients in creating the centrality of self-destructive ideas and images in commercial hip hop." This analysis of how the music industry profits from these harmful representations. Adam Bradley writes, "Rap's greatest storytellers are among the greatest storytellers alive, staying close to the tones of common speech even as they craft innovations on narrative form," a statement that underscores Lamar's ability to speak to complex themes in an accessible way. He tackles issues of masculinity, race, and class, demonstrating how Black culture is exploited for the benefit of others. Howard also observes that "Lamar implies in 'Not Like Us' that Drake's collaborations are strategically calculated, instead of being in touch with the understanding of the Black experience." Finally, "The Rap Yearbook" by Shea Serrano states, "The best iteration of rap is self-aware (or the self-reflective)," with Kendrick calling out Drake for profiting from the Black experience without truly embracing or understanding it.</p>                
                
                <blockquote>“No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer"</blockquote>

                <h4>Personal Significance</h4>
                <p>When I first heard "Not Like Us," I remember leaving church on Sunday on my way back to my cousin's house to watch the Miami F1 Grand Prix. My first thought was, "Oh, he destroyed Drake," and "Oh, it is done. This was the K.O. Punch," but as I listened to it more and more, I digested more. Aside from the fact that Kendrick Lamar had this ongoing beef with Drake, he really used this as an opportunity to call out Drake on his issues and, overall, an entire industry on issues that were bright as day but hidden in the dark. For example, he calls out Drake for constantly going to Atlanta to make music with "his brothers". Instead, he uses that to remain number one and move forward without regard for anyone else. Personally, this hit me as a way to see that Drake uses people and that frustration is built up; I understand what it's like to be used. The title "Not Like Us" reminds us that there are two types of people in the world: people who get it and those who do not. Drake does not get it, black culture, and instead profits from it. This gave me a reality check to see how authentic I am with myself and everyone and even the role it plays. The more I listened to "Not Like Us," the more it grew on me as a celebration song, something along the lines of taking down the final boss. Lamar is very inspiring on the track; it pushed me with my challenges and made sure I kept my perspective on my world. Earlier this year, I was diagnosed with Testicular Cancer. I was scared because of the unknowns, and I went through everything I had control over: Blood work, CT scan, and Surgery. Throughout this, I had to keep my head up high and remain strong so that my results would come back clear and I could return to a semi-normal lifestyle. The connection I'm trying to make is that Kendrick used this song to "stand on business" and push forward through all the hate and backlash that came with it. Now, when I listen to the song, I think of the same thing with my situation: that I "stood on business" to get rid of my cancer. Maria Sherman of the Associated Press wrote, "The truth is, of course, the song stands on its own: a triumphant declaration of West Coast hip-hop, funny and bombastic." These are the words I would have used to describe the song. Overall, Kendrick embodied courage in a song to speak up and say that even though people try to draw between us, "They do not like us."</p>
